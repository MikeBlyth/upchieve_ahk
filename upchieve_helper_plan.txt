Purpose: Assign hotkeys to activate toolbar items. Some items are in a submenu so we first click Shapes and then Rectangle, for example. A few are single clicks, for example Select. Colors are always chosen by clicking on MenuColorsTarget then on a specific color like ColorRedTarget.
	FindAndClick is found in ahk_utilities with signature
	FindAndClick(TargetString, x1 := "", y1 := "", x2 := "", y2 := "", err1 := 0.15, err2 := 0.10) {


Menu_Range is (488,1600) to (1900, 1800)
function ClickButtons(button_1, button_2) is like
	- Save current mouse position
	- Within menu_range
		- FindAndClick button_1
		  Wait 10 ms
		- FindAndClick button_2 if it is specified
	- Return to mouse position


-----------------
Plan 1

Make \ a hotkey {
	- if not in target window (Upchieve) then do nothing; return
	- capture the next two characters with 2 sec timeout
	- check whether they fit a pattern (ValidCommand() function)
		- yes: send to a command processor
		- no: send the characters including the \ and exit
}		
		
Concept of command structure. Validate by ensuring both chars are in these sets
	- first key = tool
		A = big text	MenuTextTarget, SubmenuBigTextTarget, 
		a = small text	MenuTextTarget, SubmenuSmallTextTarget
		l = line		MenuShapesTarget, SubmenuLineTarget
		> = arrow		MenuShapesTarget, SubmenuArrowTarget
		t = triangle	MenuShapesTarget, SubmenuTriangleTarget
		r = rectangle	MenuShapesTarget, SubmenuSquareTarget
		c = circle		MenuShapesTarget, SubmenuCircleTarget
		P = thick pen	MenuPenTarget, SubmenuThickPenTarget
		p = thin pen	MenuPenTarget, SubmenuThinPenTarget
		s = select		MenuSelectTarget
	- second key = color. Targets are named Color{color name}Target, like ColorBlackTarget
		k = Black
		n = Navy
		r = Red
		s = Sand
		t = Teal
		b = Blue
		m = Magenta
		g = Green
		o = Orange
		y = Yellow
		c = Clear
		x = none
	    Colors all require two buttons: MenuColorsTarget and the specific color target
		
Processing:
	- ClickButtons target(s) associated with first character. For example, ClickButtons(MenuTextTarget, SubmenuBigTextTarget)
	- 20 ms pause
	- ClickButtons targets associated with second character (color) if not 'none' (x). For example, ClickButtons(MenuColorsTarget,ColorRedTarget)
	
		
---------------------------

Plan 2

This is simpler because it only needs the simple ClickButtons() function and one hot key for each action. 

A hot key for each action, whether a tool or a color
Left Alt + 
		A = big text	MenuTextTarget, SubmenuBigTextTarget, 
		a = small text	MenuTextTarget, SubmenuSmallTextTarget
		l = line		MenuShapesTarget, SubmenuLineTarget
		> = arrow		MenuShapesTarget, SubmenuArrowTarget
		v = triangle	MenuShapesTarget, SubmenuTriangleTarget
		z = rectangle	MenuShapesTarget, SubmenuSquareTarget
		c = circle		MenuShapesTarget, SubmenuCircleTarget
		P = thick pen	MenuPenTarget, SubmenuThickPenTarget
		p = thin pen	MenuPenTarget, SubmenuThinPenTarget
		s = select		MenuSelectTarget
	- Colors. Targets are named Color{color name}Target, like ColorBlackTarget
		k = Black
		n = Navy
		r = Red
		j = Sand
		t = Teal
		b = Blue
		m = Magenta
		g = Green
		o = Orange
		y = Yellow
		h = Clear
		x = none

Examples:
 alt+A -> ClickButtons(MenuTextTarget, SubmenuBigTextTarget)
 alt+b -> ClickButtons(MenuColorsTarget, ColorBlueTarget)
