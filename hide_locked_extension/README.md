# UPchieve Locked Row Hider

This is a simple, single-purpose Chrome extension that hides the students who need coaches in subjects you are not certified for.

## Installation

1.  Unzip the extension folder to the desired location. It doesn't have to be in the default location but needs to be somewhere stable.
2.  Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner.
4.  Click the "Load unpacked" button.
5.  Select the `hide_locked_extension` folder where you saved it.

The extension is now active and will automatically hide the locked rows whenever you are on the UPchieve website. Enable or disable it by clicking the extension icon.
